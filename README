newstools
=========

This package contains tools to post various things to a newsgroup.  It
depends on libpthread, libcurl, libexpat and libgcrypt.  It runs on
Linux but should not be too hard to get going on other UNIX platforms.


Installation
------------

  ./configure
  make
  make install

(as ever see INSTALL for more info.)


lj2news
-------

lj2news reads the RSS feed provided by Livejournal, formats it to
plain text, and posts it to a newsgroup.

See "man lj2news" for documentation.

I suggest that you start by posting to a test newsgroup and setting
the -x option to something (any nonempty string will do).  Adjust the
command line until you are happy.  For each test (that posts anything)
you will need a fresh -x value.

When you are happy remove the -x option and set the -n option to point
to the newsgroup you really want to post to.

You can run the command manually or put it in a cronjob to run
e.g. once a day.

Be careful with cronjobs, sometimes their environment differs from the
interactive environment.  For instance you may need to explicitly set
NNTPAUTH and NNTPSERVER (though you can use the -s option instead of
the latter.)

For instance, I have the following in a script, which I execute from a
cron job:

  #!/bin/bash
  set -e
  export NNTPAUTH="md5cookie1way richard"
  lj2news \
    -a "http://www.greenend.org.uk/rjk/;richard+ljua@sfere.greenend.org.uk" \
    -t ewx \
    -f "Richard Kettlewell <rjk@greenend.org.uk>" \
    -n chiark.journals \
    -s chiark-tunnel \

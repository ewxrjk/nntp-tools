.SH NOTES
.SS "bzr or git?"
.B git2news
and
.B bzr2news
are actually the same program, which figures out what version control
system it is dealing with by inspection, only falling back on the
name it is invoked as if its heuristics fail.
.SS "Character Encodings"
.B git2news
always posts in UTF-8.
For commit messages this is unproblematic as \fBgit\fR can produce
UTF-8 on demand.
For diffs, it assumes that the tracked files, and therefore the diffs,
following the current locale's encoding, and translates from that to
UTF-8.
.PP
.B bzr2news
always follows the current locale's encoding.
.PP
.B --preview
output reproduces the bytes that would be sent to the news server, so
it can produce UTF-8 even in a non-UTF-8 locale.
.SS "Commit Tracking"
The set of commits already posted is tracked in a \fI.seen\fR file
adjacent to the repository.
You can delete this file to force articles to be reposted (for
instance to another newsgroup or news server).
.PP
Message IDs are computed from details of the commit and (if it is
specified) the "salt" value given to the \fB-x\fR option.
The news server will reject duplicate message IDs (if they are not
from so far in the past that it has purged them from its database) so
if you want to re-post articles you may need to pass a salt value.
.PP
The main use of \fB-x\fR is for testing - for instance you might
initially post to a test group with a random salt value, then delete
the \fI.seen\fR file and remove the salt for production.
.PP
The salt value does not affect the commit tracking in the \fI.seen\fR
file.
.SS "NNTP Authentication"
Currently only AUTHINFO GENERIC is supported.

.SH NOTES
.SS Salt
The
.B -x
option is useful in testing your setup.
.PP
.B bzr2news
relies on the news server to keep track of which messages have been
sent and which not, so if you post all your articles in a test group
but then want to repost them to a "real" group then the message IDs
will clash and the articles will be silently rejected.  In this case
you should change the salt value when switching between the test and
live groups.
.PP
The suggested approach is to use a nontrivial salt in testing and
remove it when going live.
.SS "NNTP Authentication"
Currently only AUTHINFO GENERIC is supported.
